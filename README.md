# February Daily JavaScript

## Purpose
Just to make sure I am not forgetting past covered inforation I have been doing daily javascript excersises to keep sharp. I am going to have to make a new repo each month to hold them all as the files are getting quite large. 

## Process
Ijust find random daily javascript excersises and I close my eyes and choose one. Ive done most of the easy ones and I am alsmost done with the medium. Lately I have been tmiming myself to see how fast I can get them done.
